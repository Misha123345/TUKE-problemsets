## Project Structure

- `Fundamentals of C programming/` - Contains 7 problem sets from the "Fundamentals of C Programming" course. Each problem set includes a Makefile for compilation using the `make` utility.
- `Programming in C/` - Contains 6 problem sets from the "Programming in C" course. Each problem set also includes a Makefile for compilation using the `make` utility.
- `Bonus task in React/` - Contains an additional assignment developed using React. To run this project, use `npm install` and `npm start` in the console.

## Installation and Running

To run the C programs, you need a C compiler such as GCC and the `make` utility installed on your system. Follow these steps to compile and run a program:

### For C Programs

1. Navigate to the directory with the problem set:
    ```sh
    cd "Fundamentals of C programming/ps1"
    ```

2. Compile the program using `make`:
    ```sh
    make
    ```

3. Run the compiled program:
    ```sh
    ./ps1
    ```

### For the React Assignment

1. Navigate to the `Bonus task in React` directory:
    ```sh
    cd "Bonus task in React"
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
